<h1>Test Page for Test Chrome Popup Extension</h1>

<p><i>Philip Dorrell, 19 August, 2013</i></p>

<h2>test-popup-extension</h2>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/pdorrell/test-popup-extension">test-popup-extension</a></b>
is a template for a Chrome browser extension where a popup windows acts on the contents
of the target tab.
</p>

<p>This test page lets you load the popup directly, i.e. without having to install (or reload) 
the Chrome extension.</p>

<h2>How to Run the Extension Code Outside of the Extension</h2>

<p><b>test-popup-extension</b> is configured so that you can run the extension code during
development without installing the extension. You don't even have to be running in Chrome or
Chromium.</p>

<p>There are three ways you can do this:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Click this button: <button onclick="createTitleEditorWindow();">Create Title Editor Window</button></li>
 <li>Load this page with the <b>load</b> query, i.e.
<a href="index.html?load"><b>index.html?load</b></a>.</li>
 <li>Load the page <a href="index_load.html"><b>index_load.html</b></a>, which
redirects to <b>index.html?load</b>. (This is a useful option when
the browser command line refuses to let you include characters like "?" in the URL argument.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enabling Popups</h3>

<p>If you click the button to create the popup, it gets created, no questions asked. Same thing
when you click the browser action button for the installed browser extension. But if you
load this page with the <b>?load</b> query string, then the popup is created via Javascript, something
that web browsers do not enable by default (due to the potential for abuse from web pages that create
a thousand popups each time you visit).</p>

<p>During development of your own popup, you probably do want to see the popup as soon as possible
each time you load the test page, i.e., no clicking on buttons, and no telling the browser "Allow popups from ..." etc.
When developing against Chrome (or Chromium), which is the browser
that is going to be running your extension, you can use the command line parameter 
<b><a href="http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/#disable-popup-blocking">--disable-popup-blocking</a></b>
to get confirmation-free opening of popup windows from your Javascript.</p>

<h2>How to Install the Extension</h2>

<p><b>Chrome</b> makes it very easy to install an extension during development &ndash; you
go to the "Extensions" page in the browser (under the "Tools" menu), and tell it 
to "Load unpacked extension ...".</p>

<p>The <b>test-popup-extension</b> project has all the extension files in the <b>extension</b>
subdirectory, so that's the directory you load the unpacked extension from.</p>

<h2>How the Popup Window Performs Actions on the Target Tab</h2>

<p>What makes popup windows in Chrome extensions slightly difficult is that the Chrome
browser does <i>not</i> allow access to <b>window.opener</b>. Instead, all communication between
windows must be via <b>chrome.runtime.onMessage</b> and <b>chrome.tabs.sendMessage</b>.</p>

<p><b>test-popup-extension</b> deals with the differences between normal popup windows
and extension popup windows by defining functionality on the content tab in 
the form of an object which can be executed either "locally", or "remotely" via the Chrome 
extension messaging API.</p>

<p>For details of how this is done, see the source code. A brief summary is:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Define a target object representing actions to be performed on the content (target) tab
(in this case <b>TitledWindow</b>).</li>
 <li>Define all "public" methods on the target object with two parameters: a <b>request</b> object,
and a <b>result handler</b> (in this case, the <b>getPageDetails</b> and <b>setWindowTitle</b> methods). 
The request object wraps actual parameter values, and the result handler
is used to process the result of the method (i.e. instead of using <b>return</b>).</li>
 <li>In the popup window's Javascript, define a <b>proxy</b> for the target object which has
the same public method signatures, but which implements the methods by sending messages to the 
content tab (in this case <b>TitledWindowProxy</b>).</li>
 <li>In the content tab's Javascript, define a handler for messages, which passes them on to
the local target object, and then passes the results back to the result handler of the message handler.</li>
</ul>
