Test Chrome Extension with Popup Window
=======================================

This project is an example of a Chrome Extension which brings up a pop-up window
when the extension action is clicked, where the popup-window uses messaging in order
to take actions on the target tab.

This particular extension retrieves the title of the target tab, and allows the user
to update the title.
